## Turn Selfie Into Lifelike Pencil Sketch Using Gemini AI | Free Step By Step Tutorial

With the uploaded reference image as the subject, create a photorealistic image of a graphite pencil sketch on clean white notebook paper depicting a face that perfectly matches the reference in every facial feature, proportion, and expression. The drawing should display authentic pencil strokes with natural variation in pressure, producing a full range of graphite tones from light to dark. Include visible hatching and cross-hatching patterns, along with the organic imperfections of genuine hand-drawn line work. Subtly reveal faint construction lines and preliminary sketch marks beneath the finished portrait—partially erased yet still visible—to convey the authentic artistic process. The paper should have realistic texture, visible grain, and a matte surface interacting naturally with the graphite. Illuminate the scene with soft, natural lighting that enhances both the pencil marks and the paper texture.

Now, generate an images in different realistic settings:

Studio Desk Setting
Show the sketch resting on an artist’s wooden desk beside sharpened pencils, an eraser, and light graphite dust. Soft daylight streams through a nearby window, highlighting the texture of the paper and pencil work.

Sketchbook Scene
Depict the sketch on an open spiral-bound sketchbook with other faint pencil drawings visible on adjacent pages. The sketchbook lies on a neutral tabletop with natural morning light.

Art Exhibition Display
Present the pencil sketch mounted in a simple white frame hanging on a gallery wall with subtle directional lighting that casts a gentle shadow, emphasizing the realism of the graphite.

Outdoor Setting
Show the sketch placed on a wooden picnic table outdoors with soft sunlight, a few leaves scattered around, and gentle wind wrinkles on the paper to make it look naturally photographed.

Close-up Macro View
Create an extreme close-up of a section of the sketch—showing detailed pencil strokes, subtle smudges, and visible paper fibers—to emphasize the tactile realism of graphite on paper.
